std::vector<bool> is a special case that uses bit packing to store booleans, which can lead to performance issues when accessing individual elements.  The performance is often worse than using std::vector<char> which is more memory efficient for boolean values when packing is not important. Accessing elements is slower and the lack of direct element access leads to non-intuitive code behavior.
